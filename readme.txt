we will build calculator using html, css, js. we will design later. first we will add all the necessary things. 

create html file. 

if a one tag is covered in another tag then we can access it with the reference of that tag. 

like if input is covered in form that then we can access it by form.input.value.


if we use form.input.value=1, then if we want to write 11 it will replace first 1 and write only 1 instead of 11
so we used form.input.value+=1. 
eval() to perform the action of user input like add, sub, mul, divide. it is by default. we don't need to write if else large code. 

we want to show that there should be only one symbol between the values. if i use + and then i use -, then + 
should change with -, instead of coming in front of + in input. 
if user press same symbol multiple times, then it will write only one time. we can do it by js. 

we will detect last value in the input and if it is symbol and user again enter that symbol, we will replace it by new symbol. 

Now the last is to design css.
